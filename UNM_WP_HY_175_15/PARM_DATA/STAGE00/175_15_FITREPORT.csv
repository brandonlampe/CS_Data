The following model was used to fit the fractional density:
def linear(x, slope, intercept):
    fden = slope * x + intercept
    return fden

Scaled Error Norm: 5.754695e-03

[[Correlations]] (unreported correlations are <  0.100)
    C(slope, intercept)          = -0.866 

Model was fit to the following domain (x) -> Duration (days)
Start, 0
End, 1.06

Raw data was interpolated every 10 sec.
