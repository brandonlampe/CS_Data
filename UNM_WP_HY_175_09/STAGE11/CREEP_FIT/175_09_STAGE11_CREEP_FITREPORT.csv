Analysis by Brandon Lampe, performed on: 2016/07/12 20:20:33

The following model was used to fit the fractional density:
def schnute(x, start, end, a, b, c, d):
    fden = (c**b + (d**b - c**b) * (1 - exp(-a*(x - start)))/(1 - exp(-a*(end - start))))**(1 / b)
    return fden

Scaled Error Norm: 1.441148e-04
