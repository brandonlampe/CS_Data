# Repository for Crushed Salt Data
**Grand No: 456417**

This is a work in progress!

## Repository Content

### Directory Names
A uniform namining structure still in progress, but in general directories are named according to the following:
 - Names contain no spaces, a single underscore "_" will be used as a file name seperator.
 - Files are for the Crushed Salt Project (CSP); therefore, the first three charaters of each file are "CSP".
 - Folders are organized by which frame the test was performed on i.e., A2 or A3.
 - The fifth and sixth charaters of each file name will therefore be "A" followed by the frame number.
 - Files are chronologically labeled in order of tests performed on a specific frame.That is to say numbering is frame specific (e.g., 01, 02,...,nn tests performed on a specific frame)Therefore the final two characters will be the test number.

### Crushed Salt Testing
The bulk of current repo contents are tests on crushed salt performed at Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM.  Future contents of this repository include:
 - Photographs of crushed salt samples (pre and post testing)
 - Permeability test results
 - Thermalconductivity test results
 - Porosity test results
