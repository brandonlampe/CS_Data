# Repository for Crushed Salt Data
**Grant No: 456417**

This is a work in progress!

## Directory Names
A uniform namining is structure still in progress.  Tests completed early in the series begin with "CSP", while those performed later begin with "UNM". In general directories are named according to the following:
- Names contain no spaces, a single underscore "_" will be used as a file name seperator.
1. Files beginning with CSP (Crushed Salt Project) were named according to:
   - Folders are organized by which frame the test was performed on i.e., A2 or A3.
   - The fifth and sixth charaters of each file name will therefore be "A" followed by the frame number.
   - Files are chronologically labeled in order of tests performed on a specific frame.That is to say numbering is frame specific (e.g., 01, 02,...,nn tests performed on a specific frame)Therefore the final two characters will be the test number.
2. Files beginning with UNM (University of New Mexico) are named according to:
  + Labels for specific directories follow: `UNM_Salt Location_Test Type_Test Temperature_Number in Series`
  + `Salt Location` $\implies$ WP = WIPP, AI=Avery Island
  + `Test Type` $implies$ HY = Hydrostatic Consolidation, TX = Traditional Triaxial Consolidation
  + `Test Temperature` $\implies$ approximate confining fluid temperature (degrees Celsius)
  + `Number in Series` $\implies$ the chronogical order of tests performed with the same `Salt Location`, `Test Type`, and `Test Temperature`
    
## Crushed Salt Testing
The bulk of current repo contents are tests on crushed salt performed at Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM.  Future contents of this repository include:
 - Photographs of crushed salt samples (pre and post testing)
 - Permeability test results
 - Thermalconductivity test results
 - Porosity test results
